# Testnet Lending and Borrowing Canister

A decentralized lending and borrowing platform built on the Internet Computer, enabling users to leverage their BIT10 tokens as collateral to borrow various assets across different blockchain networks. This canister handles the core logic for managing lending offers and borrowing requests, ensuring secure and transparent financial operations.

## üåü Overview

This project provides the backend infrastructure for a cross-chain lending and borrowing protocol, specifically designed to integrate with BIT10 tokens as collateral. The primary goal is to allow users to deposit BIT10 tokens as collateral and borrow other specified tokens, bridging liquidity between the Internet Computer and other supported chains. The canister leverages ICRC-1/ICRC-2 and other token standards for on-chain asset transfers and can interact with external services via secure HTTP outcalls to fetch real-time data like interest rates.

## üåê Core Features

- Cross-Chain Collateral & Borrowing: Facilitates lending and borrowing operations where BIT10 tokens (Test BIT10.TOP, Test BIT10.MEME) on the ICP serve as collateral for borrowing other designated assets.
- Dynamic Interest Rates: Integrates with external HTTP APIs via `ic_cdk::api::management_canister::http_request` to fetch real-time interest rates, allowing for flexible and market-driven lending/borrowing terms.
- Robust Input Validation: Ensures all provided Principal IDs (lender, borrower, token ledgers) are valid, preventing common errors and potential vulnerabilities.
- Modular Architecture: Codebase is split into logical modules (`types`, `storage`, `controllers`, `lend_borrow`, `http_client`, `canister_config`) for enhanced maintainability, readability, and scalability.
- Stable Memory Management: Employs `ic-stable-structures` for persistent storage of canister configurations (like controllers), allowing state to survive canister upgrades.
